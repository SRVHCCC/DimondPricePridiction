## Diamond Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the price of diamonds using various machine learning algorithms. It addresses a regression problem, aiming to predict a continuous value (the price) based on several input features related to the characteristics of diamonds.

### Overview:
- **Problem Type**: Regression
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training and evaluation contains information about the attributes of diamonds, such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions, along with their corresponding prices.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines (GBM).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluation of the models is performed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score to assess their predictive performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the models. The trained models are then evaluated on the testing set to measure their accuracy and generalization capability.

### Usage:
1. **Setup Environment**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the required packages using `requirements.txt`.
   
2. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that your dataset is preprocessed and formatted properly before training the models. Features should be appropriately scaled and encoded as necessary.

3. **Model Training**: Run the training script to train different machine learning models on the dataset. Experiment with various algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best-performing model.

4. **Model Evaluation**: After training, evaluate the trained models using the testing dataset. Calculate relevant evaluation metrics to assess the performance of each model.

5. **Deployment**: Once you have selected the best-performing model, you can deploy it to make real-time predictions on new data or integrate it into your applications.
